# python-challenge

## PyBank


* In this challenge, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was given a dataset with two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. My script calculates the total number of months, the net total of Profit/Loss over the entire period, the greatest increase in profits, and the greatest decrease in profits.


## PyPoll


* In this challenge, I created a Python script for analyzing the voting records I was given. My script totals the votes and gives a count for each candidate. It also determines the winner based on popular vote.


Each script also writes the results to a text file as well as displaying them on the screen.
